  This repository contains my solutions to various <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> problems using <strong>Python</strong> 🐍.  
  I'm using this as a way to improve my competitive programming and algorithmic thinking skills.

## ✨ Highlights

- 📌 All problems are solved in **Python 3**
- 🧠 Focus on writing clean, readable, and efficient code
- 🗃️ Categorized by **divisions and difficulty levels**
- 📚 Constantly updated as I solve more problems

---

## 🧠 My Goal

> To become better at problem-solving, competitive programming, and eventually rank up in Codeforces!  
> I also want to track my growth through open-source contribution and consistency. 🚀

## 🔍 How to Navigate

- Browse folders by difficulty level
- Each file is named using the format: `ProblemNumber_ProblemName.py`
- Solutions may include inline comments explaining the logic

---

## 🌱 Work in Progress

- [ ] Add problem statements as docstrings
- [ ] Include time/space complexity analysis
- [ ] Weekly progress tracking
- [ ] Auto-scraper for pulling problems + metadata (future idea)
